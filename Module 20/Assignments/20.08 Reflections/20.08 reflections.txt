1. Think back to when you decided to take AP Computer Science.
  - What were your reasons for taking the course?
  - Describe what you used to think computer science was all about.
  - What did you think you were going to learn?

I took AP Computer Science because I want to become a programmer. I used to think Computer Science was about programming. I thought we were going to learn how to program.

2. Consider how far you have come from your first HelloWorld.java program.
  - Today, if someone asked you what computer science is about, what would you say?
  - Describe some things that you learned that surprised you during the course.
  - When you think about the future, in what ways are you better or less prepared to deal with technology issues that may affect you personally or society in general?

I would tell them it's about programming java. Nothing really surprised me. I can now program and thus my resume is better for the increasingly digital world.

3. Describe a lesson that was challenging or interesting. What was it about the lesson that made it memorable?

The picture lab was cool especially when it came time to manipulate the pictures by either changing RGB values or cutting and pasting them.

4. Describe a lesson that you would like to see changed. Make a specific recommendation to improve this lesson.

All the labs need WAY more documentation. Some Activities can be ridiculously difficult - especially since this is many people's first programming course. Also this document shouldn't be required to be at least 
two single-spaced pages as each kid's experience in this course will vary such that their answers to these questions may be different. Additionally I knew what I was getting into when I took this course so that's
why many of my answers are short.

5. What career possibilities do you see for yourself in the future? How might technology be involved?

I want to program software for a living. So I'll work with computers.
